# Snake Game written by DeepSeek R1

## About the code

This code was generated by DeepSeek R1 with the following prompts:

> Q: Write me a simple snake game in Rust. It runs in the terminal.

> A: \*garbage code\*

> Q: Very cool. Now write a snake game with SDL2.

> A: \*code that actually works, perfectly (provided you install a font)\*

> Q: Does it support loading a byte array as fonts? If it does, I want to replace `ttf_context.load_font("arial.ttf", 24)` with some thing that uses `include_bytes!("arial.ttf")`.

> A: \*another working code, but with a single clippy warning\*
